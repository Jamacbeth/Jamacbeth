## Hi there 👋

I’m currently working through a full-stack design and development program that covers everything from UI/UX to front-end and back-end technologies. I've completed a UI/UX course and am diving deeper into real-world projects using version control and collaboration through GitHub.

## About Me

I'm passionate about both design and development. With a background in tools like **Adobe XD**, **Illustrator**, and **Photoshop**, I focus on creating clean, user-focused interfaces. I’m now expanding into full-stack development with a strong interest in front-end frameworks and dynamic web apps.

## I’m Currently Working On

- Strengthening my UI/UX design skills using **Adobe XD**, **Illustrator**, and **Photoshop**  
- Practicing real-world **version control and collaboration** workflows using **Git** and **GitHub**  
- Building small interactive projects to apply UI/UX concepts in code  

## I Will Be Learning

As part of my upcoming coursework, I will be learning:

- Frontend frameworks: **React** and **Angular**  
- Backend development: **PHP**, **MySQL**, and Linux server management  
- CMS platforms: **WordPress**  
- Adobe design tools: **Illustrator**, **Photoshop**, and advanced **XD** workflows  
- Mobile web development and responsive design best practices  
- Real-world team workflows using GitHub, Git, and open-source collaboration

## I’m Looking to Collaborate On

- Beginner-friendly open source projects  
- UI/UX-focused web applications  
- Small tools or utilities that improve productivity or accessibility
